// Task 2: Tab hover effect

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// This task is to create a hover effect for the tabs in the navigation bar.

// When the user moves the mouse over a tab, the tab will transform in
// appearance. You have the flexibility to select various effects, such as
// altering the background color, adjusting the text color, or scaling the tab
// itself. If scaling is employed, the neighboring tabs should adjust position
// to accommodate the scaling effect seamlessly.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// This code can be completed with the following number of lines of code: 
//
// Lines of JavaScript code: 20 or less

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Your code begins here!

// Domcontentloaded event is used to make sure that the JavaScript code is
// executed after the HTML content is loaded.
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {

    // Get all the tabs in the navigation bar
    
    // --- Your code here ---

    // Add an event listener to each tab to listen for the mouseover and
    // mouseout (i.e., add two event listeners for each tab using a loop).
    
    // --- Your code here ---

        // Indentations are implied to show that the code below is within the
        // event listener.
   
        // Add a hover effect to the tab, such as changing the background color
        // or changing the text color. 'mouseover' event occurs when the mouse
        // is over the tab. 'hover' class is added to the tab to apply the hover
        // effect.
        
        // --- Your code here ---

        // Remove the hover effect from the tab by changing it back to the
        // original state. 'mouseout' event occurs when the mouse is out of the
        // tab. 'hover' class is removed from the tab to remove the hover
        // effect.
        
        // --- Your code here ---
